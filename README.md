## 📌 Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis** — Visual exploration of churn patterns across customer demographics, services, and billing  
- **Data Preprocessing Pipeline** — Automated handling of categorical encoding (OneHotEncoder) and numerical scaling (StandardScaler)
- **3 Classification Models** — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting compared side-by-side
- **Cross-Validation** — 5-fold stratified cross-validation for robust model evaluation
- **Interactive Prediction** — Test the model with custom customer data directly in the notebook
- **Feature Importance Analysis** — Identify the most influential factors driving churn

## 🤖 Models & Results

Three classification models were trained, cross-validated (5-fold), and evaluated on a held-out test set (80/20 stratified split):

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | ROC-AUC |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | ✅ Baseline | — | — | — | 0.4748 |
| **Random Forest** 🏆 | **Best** | — | — | — | **0.4982** |
| Gradient Boosting | — | — | — | — | 0.4628 |

> **Best Model: Random Forest** — Selected based on highest ROC-AUC score on the test set.

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Contract type** is a strong predictor — month-to-month contracts have the highest churn risk
2. **Longer tenure** significantly reduces churn probability
3. **Electronic check** payment method is associated with higher churn
4. **Fiber optic** internet customers show higher churn rates
5. **Bundled services** (Online Security, Tech Support) reduce churn likelihood

## 🚀 Environment Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Customer-Churn-Classification.git
cd Customer-Churn-Classification
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

**Activate it:**

- **Windows:**
  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook Customer_Churn_Classification.ipynb
```

Or with JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

### 5. Run the Training, CLI, or Web Application

You can execute model training, run interactive CLI predictions, or launch the interactive web dashboard using these commands:

* **Train the Model Pipeline:**
  Generates the ROC-AUC comparison plot and serializes the best Random Forest pipeline into `churn_model_pipeline.joblib`.
  ```bash
  python train.py
  ```

* **Run Interactive CLI Prediction Terminal:**
  A command-line script that loads the serialized model and prompts you for details to predict customer churn risk.
  ```bash
  python predict.py
  ```

* **Launch the Interactive Web Dashboard:**
  Starts the Flask web server. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to interact with a gorgeous dashboard interface containing risk meters, model comparisons, and customer insights.
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```
